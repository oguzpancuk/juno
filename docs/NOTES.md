# Working notes — append-only, dated

<!-- The session-to-session memory. Every work session appends: what was
     done, what was verified (and how), what is open. Newest at top.
     Never rewrite old entries — this file is the audit trail. -->

## Upstream candidates

<!-- Improvements made HERE to template-origin files (.claude/, contracts/,
     CLAUDE.md) that maya should inherit. /update-stack harvests this list.
     Format: date · file · one-line what/why. Remove entries once upstreamed. -->

## 2026-09-08 — owner answers to PRD open questions

- All 8 answered: offline geocoding; standard synastry method researched
  and fixed as ADR-0003; Claude authors the ~360 Turkish snippets, owner
  reviews; distance filter (radius, default 50 km) replaces same-city;
  reports-only moderation; gender kadın/erkek/belirtmek istemiyorum,
  interested in kadın/erkek/herkes; developer name oguzpancuk, Apple
  membership status unknown; birth time mandatory (no unknown-time mode).
- Written: PRD rewritten with the decisions (open questions kept as an
  audit list); ROADMAP S2/S4/S5/S6 adjusted (no fallback, discover view
  with radius + preference, location on profile); v1 loses the gender
  filter and unknown-time items, gains location refresh and the Apple
  membership check; ADR-0003 (compatibility formula, synthesis from Cafe
  Astrology, Discepolo/Kerykeion, SolarSage) and ADR-0004 (ephemeris).
- Verified: docs only; nothing runnable yet.
- Open: Apple Developer Program membership and App Store name — first
  deploy session. Next: S0.

## 2026-09-08 — /spec + /mvp-scope

- Owner decisions (asked in one batch): Turkey-first, Turkish UI; template
  text, no LLM; `astronomy-engine` (MIT) for ephemeris; MVP loop is
  swipe + mutual like + in-app chat. Recorded in `docs/PRD.md`.
- Written: `docs/PRD.md` (7 core interactions, each with a "works when"
  clause; 8 open questions for the owner) and `docs/ROADMAP.md`
  (walking skeleton S0–S7, v1 list with Apple-required items, deferred
  list with reasons). Chat is v1, not skeleton: the match screen with the
  starter is the value; messaging is standard machinery.
- Assumptions taken until the owner answers PRD open questions: offline
  city list for geocoding (Q1); same-city discovery (Q4); woman/man/
  everyone preference model (Q6). Each is marked in the ROADMAP item.
- Verified: nothing runnable yet; verify.sh still FAILs by design until S0.
- Next: answer PRD open questions (at least Q1, Q3, Q6 before S3/S5/v1),
  then S0 (skeleton boot + battery).

## 2026-09-08 — instantiated from maya 22e7efe

- Repo created by /new-product. Owner delegated the stack choice (no
  technical preference); recorded as ADR-0002, not a guess.
- Filled: CLAUDE.md commands + standards + deploy, verify.sh battery,
  ci.yml, deploy-checklist product steps, .gitignore.
- Not done, by design: no code skeleton yet — verify.sh reports FAIL
  ("no root package.json") until the walking-skeleton step lands.
  `contracts/init.sh` stays unwritten until the app can boot (the
  initializer session writes it before the first unattended run).
- Open before /spec: ephemeris library + licence (Swiss Ephemeris is AGPL /
  commercial; pure-JS alternatives exist); chart interpretation and
  conversation starters — templated text vs. LLM via Edge Function; Apple
  dating-app requirements (age gate, moderation, account deletion) as PRD
  constraints.
- Next: /spec → /mvp-scope → skeleton → remotes/CI.
